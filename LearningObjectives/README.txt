For the course views, I was only able to create the simple html course page with basic info.
I'm driving back from Alaska this week from Monday to Saturday, so there hasn't been enough 
time to get a nicer Razor page working.  It would have been much more feasible if the required
readings necessary to complete this assignment had been available at the time when the assignment
was released.

Made instructor and chair kind of similar.  They share controllers because the chair is basically
a professor in that they have access to all of the courses.

Improvements: Relocate the department chair overview to the main home page.  Add databases and 
seed them.

TO ASK DURING TA HOURS:

-How to properly link to the CourseModelsController in the navigation bar.  Currently, I'm setting
   the asp-controller="CourseModels", but CourseModels is a folder, not a controller.  It seems like
   there should be a better way to do this.
   Is it this?  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/routing?view=aspnetcore-2.2
